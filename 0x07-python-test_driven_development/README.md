# 0x07 Python Test-Driven Development (TDD)

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%20%7C%203.8-blue)

This repository provides examples and explanations for Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. TDD is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a short development cycle: first the developer writes a failing test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## Description

In this repository, you will find Python code examples and explanations for applying Test-Driven Development techniques. Writing tests before writing the actual code ensures that your codebase remains robust and reliable, especially when modifications or additions are made in the future. This process helps catch bugs early and promotes better software design.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything specific to use the code in this repository. Simply clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x07-python-test_driven_development.git
```

## Usage

To run the tests in this repository, make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. You can execute the test files by navigating to the project directory and using a test runner such as `pytest`. Install `pytest` using `pip` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, run the tests using the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests will automatically discover and run all the test cases in the project.

## Testing Concepts

Here are some key testing concepts covered in this repository:

- **Unit Testing**: Writing tests for individual functions or components of your code.
- **Test Cases**: Defining specific scenarios to test different aspects of your code.
- **Assertions**: Using assertions to validate that the output of your code matches the expected results.
- **Edge Cases**: Testing scenarios that are on the boundaries of what your code can handle.
- **Mocking**: Creating mock objects to isolate the code being tested from the rest of the system.

Feel free to explore the folders and files to find examples and explanations for each concept.
