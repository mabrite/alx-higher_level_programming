## Introduction

Python exceptions are a way to handle unexpected situations or errors that can occur during the execution of a program. They allow you to gracefully handle errors, preventing your program from crashing and providing meaningful error messages to users.

This repository provides resources to help you understand and work with Python exceptions effectively. It includes code examples, explanations, and best practices.

## Getting Started

To get started with Python exceptions, you'll need:

- Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x05-python-exceptions.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd 0x05-python-exceptions
```

## Exception Handling

In the `examples` directory, you'll find Python scripts demonstrating various aspects of exception handling. These scripts cover topics like:

- Try...except blocks
- Handling multiple exceptions
- Raising exceptions
- Custom exception classes
- Handling exceptions in functions

Feel free to explore these examples to get a better understanding of how to handle exceptions in Python.

## Common Exceptions

The `common_exceptions.md` file provides a list of common exceptions in Python, along with explanations of when and why they occur. Understanding these exceptions is crucial for effective error handling.

## Custom Exceptions

In the `custom_exceptions` directory, you'll find examples of creating and using custom exceptions. Custom exceptions are useful when you need to define specific error conditions for your application.

## Best Practices

The `best_practices.md` file outlines best practices for exception handling in Python. Following these guidelines will help you write clean and maintainable code that handles errors gracefully.
