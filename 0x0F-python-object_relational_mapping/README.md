# 0x0F Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Overview

Welcome to the 0x0F Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) project! This project focuses on exploring and implementing Object-Relational Mapping techniques using Python. The goal is to bridge the gap between the object-oriented programming paradigm and relational databases, allowing developers to interact with databases using Python objects.

## Introduction

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming concepts. This project provides a practical exploration of ORM concepts in Python, allowing you to seamlessly work with databases while leveraging the power of Python objects.

## Features

- **Database Abstraction:** Work with databases without directly dealing with SQL queries.
- **Object-Relational Mapping:** Map database tables to Python classes and vice versa.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on database records using Python objects.
- **Relationships:** Define and work with relationships between different tables.
- **Query Building:** Construct complex database queries using Python syntax.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping.git
cd 0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Configuration:** Update the database configuration in the `config.py` file to match your database settings.

2. **Define Models:** Create Python classes that represent tables in your database. Use the provided base class to inherit ORM functionalities.

3. **Perform CRUD Operations:** Instantiate objects from your classes and use them to interact with the database.

4. **Querying:** Construct queries using the provided query builder or write custom queries for more complex operations.

## Examples

Check out the `examples` directory for sample code demonstrating various aspects of the ORM implementation.
