# 0x06-python-classes

## Overview

This project is a Python-based exploration of object-oriented programming (OOP) through the use of classes. It covers the fundamental concepts of defining classes, creating objects, encapsulating data, and defining methods to manipulate class instances. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn about classes in Python or an experienced developer seeking a refresher, this project provides valuable insights into OOP with Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x06-python-classes.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd 0x06-python-classes
   ```

## Usage

This project contains Python code examples and exercises related to classes. You can explore the following topics:

- **Defining Classes:** Learn how to define classes and their attributes.

- **Creating Objects:** Understand how to create instances (objects) of classes.

- **Methods:** Discover how to define methods within classes and how to call them on objects.

- **Inheritance:** Explore how to create subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.

Each topic is organized into separate Python files, making it easy to understand and experiment with the concepts.

To run the code examples, you can execute the Python files using your preferred Python interpreter:

```shell
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the name of the Python file you want to run.

## Project Structure
