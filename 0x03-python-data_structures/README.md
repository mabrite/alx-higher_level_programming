## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental components of computer science and software development. They allow you to efficiently organize and manipulate data in various ways, depending on your specific needs. This repository provides a comprehensive overview of Python's built-in data structures and how to use them effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x03-python-data_structures.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```
   cd 0x03-python-data_structures
   ```

3. Browse the code examples and explanations in the relevant directories to learn about different data structures in Python.

## Data Structures

### Lists

Python lists are one of the most commonly used data structures. They are versatile and can hold a collection of elements of various types. Learn how to create, manipulate, and work with lists in the `lists` directory.

### Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable. Discover how to use tuples for situations where you need a fixed collection of elements in the `tuples` directory.

### Dictionaries

Python dictionaries are key-value pairs that allow efficient lookup and storage of data. Explore how to work with dictionaries in the `dictionaries` directory.

### Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Learn about sets and their operations in the `sets` directory.

### Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Explore stack implementations in the `stacks` directory.

### Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Discover queue implementations in the `queues` directory.

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure consisting of nodes connected together. Learn about singly and doubly linked lists in the `linked-lists` directory.

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes connected in a parent-child relationship. Explore tree data structures and algorithms in the `trees` directory.
